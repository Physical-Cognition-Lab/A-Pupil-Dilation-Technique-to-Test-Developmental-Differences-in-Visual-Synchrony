## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into four main subfolders:
1. ### Analysis

    This folder contains all the .R files used to extract and analyze pupil dilation synchrony.
    Detailed information regarding each specific file can be found inside the folder.

2. ### Data
    This folders contains the data files used for the analysis. The raw data (*Raw.csv*) and the pre-procesed files (*ProcessedData* folders)

3. ### Results
    Contain the results of the analysis steps showcased as plots

2. ### Tutorial

    This folder contains a comprehensive tutorial that guides you through the steps to calculate and test pupil dilation synchrony between two populations using simulated data.
