This is the repository for the paper A Pupil Dilation Technique to Test Developmental Differences in Visual Synchrony.
This repository contains two subfolders:
1. Analysis
This folder contains all the R files used to extract and analyze the pupil dilation synchrony.
2. Tutorial
This folder contains a tutorial that guides you through the steps to calculate and test the pupil dilation synchrony between two populations using simulated data.
